# Jaro Winkler Distance
Find the Jaro Winkler Distance which indicates the similarity score between two Strings. The Jaro measure is the weighted sum of percentage of matched characters from each file and transposed characters. Winkler increased this measure for matching initial characters.

This implementation is based on the Jaro Winkler similarity algorithm from
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance

This Python implementation is based on the Apache StringUtils implementation from
